## üõ†Ô∏è Building
This project uses the cross platform builder [platformio](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/what-is-platformio.html).
So you will need to install that first.

The project contains multiple [environments](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/section_env.html#projectconf-section-env) for each slave. The environments you can choose are:

* `bp_ges`: Backpack GES
* `lll_ges`: Left lower leg GES
* `lul_ges`: Left upper leg GES
* `rll_ges`: Right lower leg GES
* `rul_ges`: Right upper leg GES
* `pdb`: Power distribution board slave
* `standalone_pdb`: Power distribution board, which does not use ethercat

To build all of the projects you run:

    $ pio run

This will build all the projects sequentially. When you want to build one specific environment only you can use the `--environment` (`-e`) option:

    $ pio run -e <slave>

So, for example, to build the backpack GES you run `pio run -e bp_ges`.
To actually upload the project, connect the the GES you would like to upload to and use the `--target` (`-t`) option.

    $ pio run -e <slave> -t upload
